# Hello World ~Once Again~

Hello! And welcome of the first ( and not last hopefully ) of something of a personal blog for myself!  
First of all, I'm sorry for using the same old title post everyone uses, but conventions exist for a reason!

I suppose I should start by talking a bit about myself and why I decided to do this just now. Well, the thing is, I am *nobody*, I have no more authority in any field than anyone ( I hope I'll prove me wrong with this one as I research some things to write, but we'll see ). I do have passion though, which again, is a troupe as old as time, but I do believe it. So lets get to it:

### Me, myself and I ( and why I do this )

At the time of wrting this, I am a CS ( Software Engineering really, but close enought ) student. I have been coding ( do not mistake with programming, I'll talk about that another time ) since I was around 11 years old, and I fell in love with the feeling of *digital* creation.  
Having the ability to create moving shapes and colors, *life*, that could trigger real, tangible, *human*, emotions, by writing some text in a console, or by joining some preprogrammed blocks in **![Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu "Incredible resource to learn the absolute basics of coding, aimed at kids")**. It just made something click in my tiny person brain, having always wanted to create, but having more talent for logic than creativity.  
*I now acknowledge that talent is not born with, and that any "natural" talent someone might have fades away compared to experience, but well, as said I was a kid, and still am I hope.*

As to why am I making this blog right now, well, apart from the fact that I now have a bit of time for myself, it just fell right to do this right now. I feel like the world ( globally ) is in a time of change, and a dream of mine is leaving a mark, so what better time to start I guess.  
Also I have recently seen a number of people talking about returning to the ""*old internet*"" and, while im too young to have any memories of the internet they are refering to, it is a concept that has always fascinated me. Self hosted webs ( which are not posible right now without knowing a bit of cybersecurity, which I do not know ), personals blogs ( as this one, yay! ), web rings ( I hope to join one soon ), and in general, a web that is safe and is built for people to use because they enjoy it.

### So, what can you expect?

I can't really answer that ( even tought I asked it myself ), I'll post anything that I find interesting here, from tutorials on things I like, to researches I make on different topics, hell, even most probably poems or rants I make from time to time. So don't expect this to be just computer related posts. I intend to mantain this blog as a way for me to write, because if I want to write, I rather have it up somewhere, so I can remember it when I look back.  
I do hope that this was enought to keep you hooked, and if not, even better! Thats the whole point of the "old internet" I mentioned just above, come here because you want to, not because you feel like you *have to*.

Regardless I do have some idea of what I'll post next, it will, most probably, be along the lines of:
 * *Why* game development is an art, and how to become an artist
 * A rant about BotC ( I am very excited for this one )
 * Something political ( because I, in fact, want to watch the world burn )
 * Maybe something about this webpage/something more on web rings
 * I have no idea, I just want to yap
